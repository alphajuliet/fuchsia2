Fuchsia 2
======

Description
------------
Fuchsia 2 is an HTML5 version of my original Fuchsia sticky note app, written in
JavaScript. 

We start simpler, and gradually implement more functions and eventually exceed the original.
It is largely a toy for learning purposes, but I might be productive with it one
day.

It is based on an HTML5 [demo
page](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/create-a-sticky-note-effect-in-5-easy-steps-with-css3-and-html5/)
that uses the Web SQL Database API. However, this API is no longer being
developed so I use the standard browser local storage.

There is no licence. Use it however you want.
